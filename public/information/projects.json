If you look at the code for this application, some of it will strike you as very ugly code and you can compare it with my later projects to see my growth. When I started this I had absolutely no clue how to make a web app. Through this project, I learned authentication, security, how to interact with databases, efficiency, managing real-time connections, and so much about user interface design.\n\n Words can't explain how many lessons were learned from this project. Although it is now abandoned, I learned to limit scope, write tests, use firebase, do styling, produce a responsive layout and how to become a excellent troubleshooter. \n\n This is a huge application and is currently poorly organized by my standards, however, it demonstrates an exceptional dedication to learning and improvement that has led me to being a successful software engineer.",
